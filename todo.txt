deprecated
-------------------------------------------------
Cases:
a) single .avi file or a folder with a single .avi file and an optional .wav file
b) folder with image sequences and an optional .wav file
c) folder with several .avi files and optional .wav file
Re-arrange that? How to select output folder in case a) ?!
=================================================

=================================================
in use
-------------------------------------------------
Cases:
a) folder with 1+ image sequence and an optional .wav file
b) folder with 1+ .avi files and an optional .wav file OR a single .avi file
That way maybe? Keeps the code simpler I guess.
